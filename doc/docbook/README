LANGUAGE CONSIDERATIONS
-----------------------

English documents are in 'en' sub-directories.  Other languages are
found in standard two-character sub-directories.  See, for example,
the Spanish translations in 'lessons/es'.  Currently, the following
language codes may be found in various sub-directories:

  * en - English
  * es - Spanish
  * it - Italian
  * ru - Russian

See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes> for one
listing of ISO language codes.

English DocBook source files are expected to be ASCII with xhtml
unicode markup for non-ASCII symbols.  Other language source files
should be in UTF-8.
