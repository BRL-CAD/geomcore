Building
--------

The build process for geomcore utilizes the CMake build tool.  At the
moment the code is in a state of flux and there aren't any "officially"
supported platforms - primary development typically occurs on Linux and
Mac OSX machines.

Quick Start
-----------

Out-of-source-directory compiles are encouraged, both for neatness and
to make sure code isn't making assumptions about being in the source
directory.  Assuming the source is in the directory geomcore-src and starting
from the parent directory perform the following steps:

    mkdir geomcore-build
    cd geomcore-build
    cmake ../geomcore-src
    make
