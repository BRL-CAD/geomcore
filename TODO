This is a basic developer notepad for keeping notes on development
activities and ideas.  Until the first 1.0 release, this is not a
traditional formalized TODO list of pending development actions
intended for the general public.  Please use the //TODO notation since
IDEs like Eclipse can auto generate a list of all //TODO tags in the entire
codebase.

//TODO Core Interface requires the use of brlcad-config to generate 'brlcadversion.h' via cmake.  brlcad-config is not present on windows brlcad builds, thus coreInterface will not build on windows.

//TODO Check for const-ness from top to bottom

//TODO Look at /src/GE/exception and see if anything is actually using those files.  If not, remove them.

//TODO Replace QT's signals 'n' slots functionality with a simpler in house version that utilizes the JobManager.  Signals and Slots requires a QCoreApplication.exec() to be blocked for it to work.  Hampers current design goals.

//TODO Add in 'CLEAN' target to CMAKE.  Will require tracking all the CmakeLists.txt files via global cmake var.
