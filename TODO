This is a basic developer notepad for keeping notes on development
activities and ideas.  Until the first 1.0 release, this is not a
traditional formalized TODO list of pending development actions
intended for the general public.



-Core Interface requires the use of brlcad-config to generate 'brlcadversion.h' via cmake.  brlcad-config is not present on windows brlcad builds, thus coreInterface will not build on windows.
-Check for const-ness from top to bottom
-Look at /src/GE/exception and see if anything is actually using those files.  If not, remove them.
