This is a basic developer notepad for keeping notes on development
activities and ideas.  Until the first 1.0 release, this is not a
traditional formalized TODO list of pending development actions
intended for the general public.  Please use the //TODO notation since
IDEs like Eclipse can auto generate a list of all //TODO tags in the entire
codebase.

//TODO Check for const-ness from top to bottom

//TODO Look at /src/GE/exception and see if anything is actually using those files.  If not, remove them.

//TODO Look at removing requirement for Qt

//TODO review CMake logic

Probably lots more...

//TODO Implement GSMutex/GSMutexLocker
//TODO Wire in the UUID stuff
//TODO Fix segfaults in tests
