This module holds the source code for the new geometry engine and
geometry server functionality.  The code is not stable or functional
and is only of interest for developers at this time.  If you're checking
this out, it's expected that you are a competent developer.  Please
direct all feedback to the BRL-CAD developer mailing list.  Thank you
for your patience and understanding.

geomcore requires BRL-CAD be available on the system
