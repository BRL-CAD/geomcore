variety of platforms.  If you are reading this, then you probably
already have it.

For more details on building the sources and options available, see
the INSTALL file.  To build the sources and get up and running with
default settings, run the following commands:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make

Performing a "make install" after compilation with the appropriate

using the --prefix option during configuration.  Example:

./autogen.sh
