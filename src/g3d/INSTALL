Dependencies are Qt 4, Ogre 1.7, and BRL-CAD's libbu and libged.  CMake will autodetect these if pkg-config is installed and aware of their locations, or if they are located in one of the locations CMake guesses, which generally covers standard install paths.

G3D may be built by issuing `cmake . && make`.  `make install` may or may not behave desirably, and is not currently supported.

G3D and its build process has only been tested on x86 Linux, but should function on any reasonably Unix-like system, and might even work on OSX and Windows, if you're lucky.
